  ([e6a4211](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/e6a4211), [06a0af3](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/06a0af3))
- **PCH integration** – assembly step now fully delegates to the new PCH module.  
  ([0c210c9](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/0c210c9))
- **Optimized internal x86 assembler** – removed string conversions, eliminated slice allocations in memory operand parsing, and reduced `append` calls, resulting in faster assembly generation without any API changes.  
  ([976f09c](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/976f09c))
- **Optimized linker symbol parsing** – replaced string‑based parsing with byte‑level operations to reduce allocations and improve performance for large object files.  
  ([f8ed04b](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/f8ed04b))
- **Code style cleanup** – removed extra blank lines in `cache.go` and `symbols.go`.  
  ([5c1cea5](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/5c1cea5), [f293ec0](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/f293ec0))
- **Scheduler overhaul** – replaced lock‑based queues with lock‑free ring queues, added worker‑local priority queues (8 levels), work‑stealing, and persistent worker goroutines; benchmarks show **0 allocs/op** in hot path.  
  ([bbdc2a2](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/bbdc2a2), [606913e](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/606913e), [8875114](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/8875114), [102a1d0](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/102a1d0), [e8905fb](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/e8905fb))
- **Builder cache and action cache** – replaced direct `syscall.Mmap`/`Munmap` calls with the new cross‑platform wrappers, enabling zero‑copy caching on Linux while gracefully falling back on other OSes.  
  ([f9f04ec](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/f9f04ec), [1211ba8](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/1211ba8))
- **Seal package** – unified `MachineID` signature across all platforms, added full Windows implementation, and maintained stubs for other non‑Linux OSes.  
  ([5006a7c](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/5006a7c), [4981d9e](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/4981d9e), [b3fb575](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/b3fb575))
- **RAM cache rework** – switched from mutex‑protected map to `sync.Map`, added `syscall.Mmap` for zero‑copy object storage with safe `Munmap` on eviction.  
  ([1813d6e](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/1813d6e), [a293d58](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/a293d58))
- **Assembler optimisations** – register parser rewritten to return primitives instead of allocating structs; `fmt.Errorf` replaced with pooled buffer builder; PCH mutex replaced with `sync.Map`.  
  ([ad1a260](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/ad1a260), [2539dbc](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/2539dbc), [43dfc3e](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/43dfc3e))
- **Utils/VFS refactor** – replaced `RWMutex` with `atomic.Value` in `vfs.go`; `RunCommand` now uses pipe + single reader goroutine instead of mutex‑protected buffer writer.  
  ([ded5a6c](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/ded5a6c), [8c9ec50](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/8c9ec50))
- **Seal package** – replaced `allowed` map with `sync.Map`, removed `journalMu`, and used atomic circular buffer writes.  
  ([fab854c](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/fab854c), [aa35066](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/aa35066))
- **Linker target info** – replaced `RWMutex` with `atomic.Value` for lock‑free target feature detection.  
  ([b6e7442](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/b6e7442))

### Fixed

- **Comprehensive test coverage** for dependency parsing, graph building, DAGScheduler, and PCH integration hooks.  
  ([b3c0694](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/b3c0694), [98ab763](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/98ab763), [51840fd](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/51840fd))
- **Shell command validation** – allowed `-c` (Unix) and `/C` (Windows) arguments in `RunCommand` without strict validation, enabling complex shell payloads.  
  ([0ffe97e](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/0ffe97e))
- **Build rule depfile/restat tests** – added comprehensive test coverage for dependency file parsing and incremental rebuild decisions.  
  ([96c5109](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/96c5109))
- **Seal build tags** – added proper `//go:build linux` to `seal.go` and `//go:build !linux` to `seal_stub.go`, resolving duplicate declaration errors in CI.  
  ([73014f9](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/73014f9))
- **Cross‑platform compilation for Windows** – fixed undefined `syscall.Mmap`, `syscall.Munmap`, and `syscall.PROT_READ` errors by using platform‑specific wrappers, allowing the project to build successfully on Windows.  
  ([503d7b4](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/503d7b4), [a4a37ea](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/a4a37ea), [f9f04ec](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/f9f04ec), [1211ba8](https://github.com/qecko-labs/Quench/commit/1211ba8))

### Build

- Bumped core version from **v5.3.0** to **v5.3.1**.
