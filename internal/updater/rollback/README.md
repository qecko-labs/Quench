## Rollback package

### Description

Updates can introduce regressions. This package lets a user return to a known
good binary, either the one they had before the last update or an explicit
release version, without external tools and on every supported platform.

It is a thin, well-tested layer over `internal/updater`, so downloads and
installs reuse the same safe machinery as `-update` (temp file in the executable
directory, backup, atomic rename, mode preservation, size limits, host
validation). It does not shell out to `curl` and does not assume `/usr/bin`.

### API

```go
func Run() error            // restore the previous binary (<exe>.old)
func To(version string) error // download and install a specific release
```

### -rollback

Restores `<exe>.old`, the backup that `-update` leaves behind. The swap is
atomic and reversible: the current binary is rotated into the backup slot, so a
second `-rollback` returns to where you started. Works fully offline.

### -rollback-to <version>

Downloads the requested release for the current OS/arch from the Quench
GitHub releases and installs it over the running binary using the updater's
install path. The leading `v` is optional.

```bash
qh -rollback
qh -rollback-to 5.1.0
```

### Notes

- Installs in place next to the running executable; no hardcoded system path.
- Cross-platform: Linux, macOS, Windows (asset naming from `runtime.GOOS/GOARCH`).
- `To("")` returns an error; `Run()` errors clearly when no backup exists.
- The two package-level function hooks (`restore`, `install`) are overridable in
  tests, so the logic is verified without network or root.
